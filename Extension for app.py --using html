Connecting Flask with HTML Using Templates
Once I set up Flask, I wanted to render an HTML page instead of just showing plain text. Here's how I did that step-by-step:

1. Create Folders for Templates and Static Files
Inside my project folder, I created two special folders:

templates → this is where all the HTML files go

static → this is for CSS, images, and JavaScript files (even though I didn’t use it yet)

These folder names are important because Flask looks for them by default.

2. Create an HTML File
Inside the templates folder, I created a file called index.html.

To quickly generate basic HTML structure in VS Code:

Open the file

Type ! and hit Enter
This auto-fills the standard HTML boilerplate code.

Then, inside the <body> section of the HTML, I added my own content:
now type helloworld 2 
3. Modify app.py to Render the HTML
In my app.py file, I made the following changes:

Import the render_template function from Flask:
from flask import Flask, render_template
Update the route to return the HTML file:
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

make these changes in ur app.py file and its an extenstion of that file now save and run the file 
. Run the Flask App
I saved all files and then run the app using:
python app.py
When I opened the browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000, I saw the content from index.html, and it displayed:
Hello World 2
✅ Summary
This is how I connected Flask to an HTML page using templates. 
It was a small change, but it opened the door to designing full websites with Flask!
Now I can build pages with HTML and later add CSS and JavaScript from the static folder.
